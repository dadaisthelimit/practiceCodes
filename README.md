# index.html and script.js are the files created by sir Ean for the To Do List
# toDoList: my code for adding an item from the input; the delete button appears beside the item once added
# passwordStrengthChecker: color indicator for strength; doesn't show the user what's missing if it's weak or medium; doesn't show password
# I renamed the files accordingly, DM me for questions on discord, thanks!
